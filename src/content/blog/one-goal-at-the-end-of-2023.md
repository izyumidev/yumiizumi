Time goes by so fast now. There's only one month left this year.  
This year was full of random things. Random projects on GitHub, I started this blog this year too.  
I want to end the year by sharing a goal I have been thinking about recently, which is that I want to achieve fame in a niche community.  
I don't need to be famous to the generic, but I want to be someone that people in a niche community can recognize and look up to.  
I want the ones who know the topic to be able to appreciate my accomplishments.
