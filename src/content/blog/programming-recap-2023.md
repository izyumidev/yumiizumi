The year 2023 was a pivot point for me as a developer. I will mention some of the highlights I did as a developer this year.

## Contributions on GitHub

This year, I've made several contributions to open-source projects, 1621 contributions, and have an ongoing streak of contributions since October 17.  
Some significants include contributions to [Dime](https://github.com/rarfell/dimeApp) (almost 500 stars!), and development of [yumi.to](https://github.com/izyumidev/yumi.to), [xcode-discord-rpc](https://github.com/izyumidev/xcode-discord-rpc), [OnlyNow](https://onlynow.yumi.to), and [OneKiji](https://github.com/onekiji/onekiji).

## Hello Rust ðŸ‘‹

I met Rust, my current favorite programming language, earlier this year and this language has thought me the importance of memory safety, which lead to me also learn about languages like C and Assembly. I started creating a video game earlier this month, which I might work on in earlier part of 2024. For now, I think Rust will be my go-to language.

## Portfolio Redesigns

I redesigned my portfolio a couple of times, and it is in my most likable state today. If you haven't yet, go check it out here: [yumiizumi.com](https://yumiizumi.com)!

## "I use nvim btw"

Iâ€™ve had multiple occasions in the past where I tried switching to neovim as the main IDE of choice, however, it never lasted. This year, I started using it again and it is still with me today. I occasionally use VSCode (cannot use without the VIM extension though), but I definitely love the snappiness of neovim.

## Blogging

I started this blog this year. Itâ€™s a great way to organize my mind and thoughts, as well as share them to the world. Hopefully, this will be something I will continue indefinitely.

## Competitive Programming

I also started programming for optimization, aka competitive programming. I started solving problems on platforms like [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). In my opinion, this is one of the most important things I will learn as a developer since computing power and memory are primary concepts in low level computing, which is an area I have gained interest recently.
