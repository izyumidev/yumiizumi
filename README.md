# My portfolio

This is my portfolio website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). Hosting is done on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Accessibility

The website is fully accessible, and has been tested with [Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?psiurl=https%3A%2F%2Fyumiizumi.com).

### Caching

There is a deduction in accessibility points related to caching, since GitHub Pages does not allow custom caching headers.
